# Lian (CPL) programming language

## Preface

### What is Lian?

It is a statically typed programming language similar to C++.

### Why design the programming language Lian?

1. C++ syntax is too ugly (too much historical baggage)
2. The learning path for C++ is too steep
3. There are too many unnecessary features

### Why name it Lian?

Lian is also named as CPL.

CP first represents C++, and CP at the beginning expresses love for C++;
One less P represents subtraction from C++;
One more L expresses addition to C++;
> CPL: C represents the first character of my name, P represents addition, and L represents the last character of another person's name.

The reason for not using CPL as its name is that there is already a programming language called CPL.

Lian represents love.

### Goals of Lian

Basic goal: replace C++
